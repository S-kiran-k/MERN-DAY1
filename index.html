        A car, or an automobile, is a motor vehicle with wheels. Most definitions of cars state that they run primarily on
        roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people, not cargo.[1][2] French inventor
        Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot built the first steam-powered road vehicle in 1769, while French-born Swiss inventor Fran√ßois
        Isaac de Rivaz designed and constructed the first internal combustion-powered automobile in 1808.\
